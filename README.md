# Continuous energy loss

The continuous energy loss approximation for ultra-high-energy proton energy losses during propagation is implemented in python, following the description in De Domenico, M. & Insolia, A., 2012. *Influence of cosmological models on the GZK horizon of ultrahigh energy protons. Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics*, 40(1), p.015201.

The implementation is verified by reproducing some of the key plots in the above paper. An initial discrepancy in the results was resolved via email with the author.
